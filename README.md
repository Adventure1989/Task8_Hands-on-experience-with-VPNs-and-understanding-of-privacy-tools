### 7.Research VPN encryption and privacy features. Write a summary on VPN benefits and limitations.

**Security:**

a) Encrypts internet traffic on public Wi-Fi  <br>
b) Protects against man-in-the-middle attacks  <br>
c) Hides browsing activity from ISP            <br>       
d) Prevents ISP throttling based on activity     <br>

**Privacy:**   <br>

a) Masks your real IP address  <br>
b) Makes online tracking more difficult  <br>
c) Reduces targeted advertising  <br>
d) Adds anonymity layer for sensitive research   <br>

**Access:**   <br>

a) Bypasses geographic content restrictions    <br>
b) Accesses region-locked streaming services     <br>
c) Circumvents censorship in restrictive countries   <br>
d) Enables remote access to home/work networks    <br>

**Financial:**     <br>

a) May find cheaper prices for flights/hotels   <br>
b) Safer online banking on public networks    <br>

**Limitations:**     <br>
Performance:    <br>

a) Reduced internet speeds    <br>
b) Increased latency/ping     <br>
c) May cause connection instability    <br>
d) Limited bandwidth on free plans     <br>

**Technical:**  <br>

a) Doesn't guarantee complete anonymity  <br>
b) Websites may block known VPN IPs    <br>
c) Some services detect and restrict VPN usage   <br>
d) May interfere with local network devices   <br>
e) Doesn't protect against malware or phishing  <br>

**Free VPN Specific:**  <br>

a) Data caps    <br>
b) Fewer server locations    <br>
c) Slower speeds due to overcrowding    <br>
d) May inject ads or track browsing    <br>
e) Limited customer support           <br>
f) May sell anonymized usage data     <br>

**Legal/Practical:**   <br>

a) Not anonymous if you log into personal accounts   <br>
b) Illegal in some countries   <br>
c) May violate terms of service for some platforms   <br>
d) Requires trust in VPN provider   <br>
e) Can't protect against browser fingerprinting  <br>


Conclusion:
VPNs are valuable tools for enhancing online privacy and security, particularly on untrusted networks. Free VPNs work well for occasional use and learning, but serious privacy advocates should invest in reputable paid services. 



## INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ##

1.What is a VPN?   <br>
*A.  Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and a remote server, routing your internet traffic through this secure connection to mask your IP address and location.*    <br>

2.How does a VPN protect privacy? <br>
*A. A VPN protects privacy by encrypting your internet traffic and hiding your real IP address, preventing ISPs, websites, and third parties from tracking your online activities and location.*  <br>

3.Difference between VPN and proxy? <br>
*A. While both mask your IP address, a VPN encrypts all traffic from your device and works at the operating system level, whereas a proxy only redirects traffic from specific applications without encryption.*  <br>

4.What is encryption in VPN?  <br>
*A. VPN encryption is the process of converting your data into an unreadable format using cryptographic algorithms (typically AES-256), ensuring that intercepted traffic cannot be deciphered by unauthorized parties.*  <br>

5.Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?  <br>
*A. VPNs cannot guarantee complete anonymity as they may log connection data, DNS leaks can occur, and determined adversaries with sufficient resources can potentially correlate traffic patterns or compromise VPN providers.*  <br>

6.What protocols do VPNs use?  <br>
*A. Common VPN protocols include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPsec, and L2TP/IPsec, each offering different balances of security, speed, and compatibility.*  <br>

7.What are some VPN limitations?   <br>
*A. VPN limitations include reduced connection speeds, potential blocking by websites and streaming services, reliance on provider trustworthiness, and inability to protect against malware or phishing attacks..*  <br>

8.How does a VPN affect network speed?   <br>
*A. VPNs typically reduce network speed by 10-50% due to encryption overhead, server distance, and routing inefficiencies, though modern protocols like WireGuard minimize this impact.*
